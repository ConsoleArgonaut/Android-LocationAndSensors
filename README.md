# Android-LocationAndSensors
An example on how to use the Location and Sensors on Android in Java

Open Sensor - Android Project for an example Application, that shows if the mobile device is currently laying still, or beeing tilted

Open Maps - Android Project for an Google Map that gets opened
For Maps you can also just create a new Project with the Google Maps Template in Android Studio.

To get location you need to get the permission for location data first. 
Then use the code "mMap.setMyLocationEnabled(true);"
